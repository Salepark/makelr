# Makelr Community Guide

Welcome to the Makelr community 👋  
This document explains how we work together, what we value, and how you can participate.

Makelr is built in public and grows through its community.

---

## Our Philosophy

Makelr is not just a product. It is a **tool-building ecosystem**.

We believe in:

- Transparency over magic
- Ownership over lock-in
- Systems over hacks
- Learning over copy-paste
- Collaboration over gatekeeping

We are building a **workflow-first automation platform**, not a black-box AI toy.

---

## Who This Community Is For

You are welcome here if you are:

- A builder who wants control over automation
- A researcher who cares about repeatable workflows
- A creator who prefers systems over tricks
- A developer who values clarity and architecture
- A user who wants to understand how things work

You do **not** need to be an expert.  
Curiosity and respect matter more than experience.

---

## Ways to Participate

### 1. Use Makelr and Give Feedback

Big ideas are welcome — but clarity and reasoning matter.

## What Makelr Is Not

To keep the project healthy, we avoid:

- Growth hacks and spam-driven features
- Dark patterns or manipulative UX
- Vendor lock-in strategies
- Hype-driven, opaque AI features
- “Magic” features that hide how things work

If a feature makes the system **less understandable**, it probably doesn’t belong here.

---

## Community Values

We care deeply about:

- Respectful communication
- Technical honesty
- Clear reasoning
- Long-term thinking
- Constructive disagreement

We do **not** tolerate:

- Harassment or personal attacks
- Discrimination or hate speech
- Trolling or bad-faith arguments
- Pressure tactics or manipulation

Please also read `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## How Decisions Are Made

- Small changes: Maintainers decide after review
- Medium changes: Discussed in issues or PRs
- Big changes: Design discussion + community feedback + maintainer decision

We aim for:
- Open discussion
- Clear rationale
- Documented decisions

But we also accept that:
> Not every decision can be perfectly democratic.

---

## Presets and Workflows Policy

Presets are:

- Starting points
- Examples
- Learning tools

They are **not**:
- “Official answers”
- “Best practices forever”
- Endorsed strategies

Users are expected to:
- Modify them
- Replace sources
- Adapt workflows to their own needs

---

## On AI Providers and Data

Makelr is designed around **BYO LLM (Bring Your Own LLM)**.

This means:
- Users control their own API keys
- Users choose their own providers
- Users are responsible for their own data usage and compliance

The project does **not** aim to:
- Spy on user data
- Centralize AI access
- Enforce provider choices

---

## How to Get Help

- Check the documentation first
- Search existing issues
- Open a new issue with:
  - Clear description
  - Steps to reproduce (if a bug)
  - Expected vs actual behavior

Good bug reports help everyone.

---

## How to Stay Involved

- Watch the repository
- Join discussions
- Review pull requests
- Share your use cases
- Help newcomers

Communities grow through **small, consistent contributions**.

---

## Final Note

Makelr exists to help people **build their own automation systems**.

Not to replace thinking.  
Not to sell magic.  
Not to hide complexity.  

But to **make complexity manageable, visible, and owned by the user**.

Thank you for being part of this journey 🚀
