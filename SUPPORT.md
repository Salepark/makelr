# Makelr Support

This document explains how to get help, report issues, and request improvements for Makelr.

Our goal is to keep support:
- Transparent
- Scalable
- Community-friendly
- Focused on solving real problems

---

## Before You Ask for Help

Please try the following first:

1. Read the documentation:
   - README.md
   - FAQ.md
   - ARCHITECTURE.md
   - DEVELOPMENT.md

2. Search existing issues:
   - Your problem may already be reported
   - You may find a workaround or solution

3. Check recent changes:
   - Look at recent commits or the CHANGELOG (if available)
   - The issue might already be fixed in the main branch

Doing this helps keep the issue tracker clean and useful for everyone.

## How to Report a Bug

If you think you found a bug, please open a GitHub Issue and include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Screenshots or logs (if applicable)
- Your environment:
  - OS
  - Browser (if frontend issue)
  - Node.js version (if backend issue)
  - Any relevant config details

Good bug reports save time for everyone.

## How to Request a Feature

We welcome feature requests, but please remember:

Makelr focuses on:
- Workflow transparency
- User ownership
- System clarity
- Long-term maintainability

When opening a feature request, include:

- The problem you are trying to solve
- Why the current system is insufficient
- A concrete proposal (if you have one)
- Alternative solutions you considered
- Who would benefit from this feature

Avoid:
- “Just add X” without context
- Vague or hype-driven requests
- Requests that turn Makelr into a black box

---

## How to Ask Questions

If you are unsure whether something is a bug or a feature request:

- Open an issue with the label: `question`
- Clearly describe what you are trying to do
- Explain what is confusing or unclear

We prefer:
- Clear questions
- Reproducible examples
- Specific use cases

---

## Security Issues

⚠️ **Do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you find a security problem:

- Follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md`
- Report it privately using the provided contact method
- Give us time to investigate and respond responsibly

Responsible disclosure helps protect everyone.

---

## What Support We Can and Cannot Provide

We can help with:

- Bugs in the codebase
- Documentation issues
- Build and setup problems
- Understanding how Makelr works
- Design and architecture discussions

We cannot guarantee:

- Custom feature development on request
- Immediate response times
- Consulting or private support
- Help with third-party services beyond general guidance

This is an open-source project. Support is best-effort and community-driven.

---

## Response Expectations

- Maintainers review issues as time allows
- Some issues may take time to investigate
- Some requests may be declined with explanation
- Polite, clear communication gets better results

Please be patient and respectful.

## Helping Others

You don’t have to be a maintainer to help:

- Answer questions in issues
- Improve documentation
- Reproduce bugs
- Suggest better problem descriptions

Community support is how open projects scale.

---

If you need help:

1. Check the docs
2. Search existing issues

Makelr grows through thoughtful questions, good bug reports, and collaborative problem solving.
