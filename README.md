# Makelr — Build Your Automation, Your Way

Makelr is a workflow designer for people who want to build their own automation — not rent someone else’s bots.

Makelr is not a “bot marketplace”.  
It is a tool to design, control, and own your own automation workflows.

---

## ✨ What is Makelr?

Makelr lets you design automation workflows by combining:

- Sources (RSS, blogs, communities, feeds, internal sources)
- Schedules (daily, weekly, custom)
- AI processing (your own LLM: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Outputs (drafts, reports, summaries)

Instead of using pre-made bots, you build and control your own workflows.

---

## 🧠 Why Makelr?

Most AI services try to sell you answers.

Makelr gives you control:

- You choose the sources
- You choose the schedule
- You choose the output format
- You approve before anything runs or is used
- You control the AI model and costs (BYO LLM)

Makelr is about control, transparency, and ownership of automation.

---

## 🔒 Safe by Default

- Human approval before data-modifying actions
- No automatic posting by default
- Draft/report-first workflows
- Clear separation between collection and usage
- No hidden promotion logic

Makelr helps you build automation you can trust.

---

## 🧩 What can you build?

Examples:

- Daily news or market briefs
- Research and academic paper trackers
- Competitor or industry monitors
- Community discussion summaries
- Custom internal reports

Templates are starting points, not answers.

---

## 🤖 Bring Your Own LLM (BYO LLM)

Makelr supports connecting your own AI providers:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini)
- Any OpenAI-compatible API

You use your own API keys.  
You control costs, limits, and models.

---

## 🌱 Open Source Direction

Makelr is being built as an open platform:

- Core workflow engine will be open source
- Adapters (sources, LLMs, outputs) will be extensible
- Presets (workflow recipes) can be shared and improved by the community

See `OPEN_SOURCE_POLICY.md` for details.

---
