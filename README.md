# Makelr — Build Your Automation, Your Way

Makelr is a workflow designer for people who want to **build and own their own automation** —  
not rent someone else’s bots.

Makelr is **not** a bot marketplace.  
It is a tool to design, control, and operate your own automation workflows.

---

## What is Makelr?

Makelr lets you design automation workflows by combining:

- **Sources** — RSS feeds, blogs, communities, internal data
- **Schedules** — daily, weekly, custom intervals
- **AI processing** — your own LLM (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- **Outputs** — drafts, reports, summaries, internal notes

Instead of using pre-made bots, you **assemble and control** your own workflow.

---

## Why Makelr?

Most AI services try to sell you answers.

Makelr gives you **control**:

- You choose the sources
- You choose the schedule
- You choose the output format
- You approve results before use
- You bring and control your own AI model (BYO LLM)

Makelr is about **ownership, transparency, and intent-driven automation**.

---

## Safe by Default

Makelr is designed with human-in-the-loop safety:

- Human approval before data-modifying actions
- No automatic publishing by default
- Draft-first and report-first workflows
- Clear separation between collection and usage
- No hidden promotion or engagement logic

You decide what runs — and when.

---

## What can you build?

Examples include:

- Daily market or news briefings
- Investment and industry research bots
- Academic or technical paper trackers
- Community discussion summaries
- Internal research and reporting tools

Templates are **starting points**, not answers.

---

## Bring Your Own LLM (BYO LLM)

Makelr supports connecting your own AI providers:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini)
- Any OpenAI-compatible API

You use **your own API keys**.  
You control **models, limits, and costs**.

---

## Open Platform Direction

Makelr is being built as an open and extensible platform:

- Core workflow engine is source-available
- Source connectors, LLM adapters, and outputs are modular
- Presets (workflow templates) can be shared and improved by the community

See [OPEN_SOURCE_POLICY.md](./OPEN_SOURCE_POLICY.md) for details.

---
