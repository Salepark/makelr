Please include as much detail as possible:

We will acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible and work on a fix.

## Disclosure Policy

- We will aim to provide a fix or mitigation as quickly as reasonably possible.
- We may coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing.
- We will credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged (unless you prefer to stay anonymous).

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The Makelr core application
- Official plugins and integrations in this repository
- Build and deployment scripts included in this repository

Third-party services, user-provided LLM APIs, and external sources are **out of scope**, but we appreciate reports if you believe an integration creates a serious risk.

At this time, Makelr does not operate a paid bug bounty program.  
However, we deeply appreciate responsible disclosure and community help in keeping the project safe.
