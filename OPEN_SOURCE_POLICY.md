# Makelr Open Source Policy

## 1. Our Philosophy

Makelr is an open workflow designer that helps people build, control, and own their own automation.

We believe:
- Users should own their workflows
- Developers should be able to extend and improve the platform
- The core infrastructure should be open, transparent, and auditable

This project is open source to encourage collaboration, trust, and long-term sustainability.

## 2. What is Open

The following parts of Makelr are open source:

- Core workflow engine
- Bot management system
- Source, schedule, and report pipeline
- UI for workflow design and control
- Integration interfaces for LLM providers and data sources

---

## 3. What is Not Included

Some parts may remain proprietary or optional in the future, such as:

- Hosted SaaS infrastructure
- Paid cloud services or enterprise features
- Branding, trademarks, and commercial offerings

The open source core will always remain available under the Apache 2.0 license.

## 4. Contribution Principles

We welcome contributions that:

- Improve stability, performance, or security
- Enhance usability and developer experience
- Add integrations, adapters, or workflow capabilities
- Improve documentation and examples

All contributions should:
- Respect user ownership and privacy
- Avoid dark patterns or vendor lock-in
- Keep the system modular and composable

## 5. Governance

- The project is currently maintained by the Makelr core team
- Major architectural decisions will be discussed openly
- We aim to move toward a more community-driven governance model over time

## 6. License

Makelr is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

This means you can:
- Use it commercially
- Modify it
- Distribute it
- Embed it in other products

As long as you follow the terms of the license.

## 7. Our Long-Term Goal

Makelr aims to become:

- A standard open platform for personal and team automation
- A toolbox, not a marketplace
- A system you control, not a service that controls you

Build your automation. Your way.
